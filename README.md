Photos-from-Flickr-by-Tag
=========================

A simple script to display photos from flickr based on how they are tagged

Simply add a .photo-set to any container to get an output of the most recent photos from flickr.

I have added the ability to display photos based on their TAG by entering ?tag= in the url.
